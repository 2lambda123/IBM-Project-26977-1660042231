Problem Statement : 
                 <li> Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle. Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels.</li>
                 <li>Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident.</li>
                 <li>To overcome this conflict, a meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life.</li>
